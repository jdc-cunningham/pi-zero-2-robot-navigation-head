I usually write into one of these things as I work on stuff but this project (branch) I've been making videos of the process.

Anyway I'm feeling drained again, slept like 6 hrs and then did my 8hr shift of software type work.

I'm not sure what it is, diet... I work out everyday (it's not a hard workout mostly lifting) it may be my diet (mostly protein and caffeine).

But anyway it is a struggle for me to have motivation after work to do stuff/have energy after work despite not being labor.

What I wanted to do right now is to plot the mesh parts in python (no visual) just purely coordinate math.

I can double check it via SketchUp or even ThreeJS plotting but I'm talking about generating a map/collision detection in 2D.
