I should be able to crap this thing out pretty quickly.

I bought the ESP8266-07 back in Feb 21

I am hoping I just select the ESP8266 type in Arduino and import Servo, be on way

I need to see what pins I can use

I'll steal the step up converter from the old SLAM project, since I've started cannabilizing that project

Ooh good thing I read the manual it's a 3.3V in device, might be expected, so will need a linear regular to step down

9:49 AM

So... I just realized I don't have a programming board for the ESP-07

So I'll switch to a Seeeduino (small arduino) and ESP-01 approach

OMG... finally got past the bad wiring on the ESP-01 that's why it wasn't working.

1:49 PM

Alright I'm done building now thankfully

I have to make the basic controller and later calibrate the motions so they go straight.

4:20 PM (aye yo)

Had a lot of problems with wiring... I ended up separating the signal wires that were together on the dev board. Now it's solid.
